Face-Emotion-Recogntion:

1. So, we can train our custom model, here with facial-emotion-recogntion.py and have a dataset as well for 5k samples, probably can use gpu in this case and run the best model for 7 different emotions and use it as well along with face recogntion. 

2. base case works real-bad so, we need to train a model for sure for 7 different emotions - 
    1. Disgust
    2. Surprise
    3. Sad
    4. Angry
    5. Fear
    6. Happy
    7. Neutral


This package - EmoPy looks good for emotional analysis from facial features, instead of text.
